# Weather App with OpenWeather API

A one page simple React app to show the weather forcast of a place entered by the users. The api used is the https://openweathermap.org/current which return the current weather report of the city with the info like temparature, visibility,rain,clouds,sunrise,sunset etc.

Here I only showed the area name to ensure that the users input and the return data match. The the temparature, the condition of the weather and condition description is shown to give a brief idea.

Following the doc it is easy to get the data.

Used useState hook to update data, fetch to get data from the api and different event handler to handle the event.

Applied some CSS to give it a visual.
